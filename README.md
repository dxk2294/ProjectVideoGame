Armed with the newly minted Spookbuster™, our hero bravely ventures forth into the decrepit pit of ghosts and ghouls. Be warned, however, for the Spookbuster™ needs 10 seconds to cool down.


## Gameplay
Fight back hordes of the undead with your handy Spookbuster and a selection of upgradable equipment, featuring gameplay reminiscent of _Vampire Survivors_ and _Project Lazarus_.
